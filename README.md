# Predicting-Popularity-of-Spotify

The purpose of this project is to utilize the Spotify tracks dataset to develop a model that can predict the popularity of a song. This model will assist future artists and musicians by providing insights into what factors contribute to a song's popularity.

We first went to look for data that would have the most popular streamed songs on Spotify
We gathered this dataset from Kaggle

This can be found in the Github as dataset.csv

The data was then cleaned to only look at the specific elements we wanted and to drop the ones we did not. Any rows that had a missing entry were taken out as to not ruin the process and the rest of the data. Also, any duplicate entries were taken out as well in order to not sway the results unrealistically. Finally, we had lessened the amount of rows to only 10,000 entries (was previously over 15,000) to remove any outliers and to get a more focused result.
